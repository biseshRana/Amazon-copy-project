# Amazon-Copy-Project
## This is a copy of an Amazon homepage and shopping cart

## Introduction:
This project uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It is a copy of an Amazon homepage with a link to a fully functional shopping cart. You cannot actually order anything on the site so the order button has been deactivated. Other functions, however, fully match functions of the Amazon homepage and shopping including: adding to cart, modifying quantity, calculating prices, choosing a delivery date, etc.
